 Lessons Learned
************************************************************

1).Feature File Error Fixing!

if you ever, encountered Feature file  steps undefined error,
even after you have clearly defined them all,

Steps to fix the problem:

Press Ctrl + comma button 
You will see now the settingd screen has opened
In the search bar, type cucumber
Click on Edit in settings.json

Now you will see something like below

  "cucumber.features": [
    "src/test/**/*.feature",
    "features/**/*.feature",
    "tests/**/*.feature",
    "*specs*/**/*.feature"
  ]
  
  Make sure you delete above and paste the exact like for like details from Cucumber.json, as per below
  
  
  "cucumber.features": [
    "src/test/features/*.feature"
  ]
  
And do the same for Cucumber.glue section..This detail should match with Cucumber.json's require value(i.e,stepdefinition path

  "cucumber.glue": [
    "src/test/steps/*.ts"
  ]
   
  Once saved these changes, close all files and the VSCode, and re-open!
  -Now you will see that the "Feature" file's error has disappeared!
  If you issue below command, the feature file will be executed along with the step definitions!
  
  npm run test
  
  





2).VSCode error in the terminal  for the NPM Command:

Nodejs\npm.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system. For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. 
At line:1 char:1


To fix this issue:
Open Powershell in admin mode and enter below command

Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

-Re-start your VS Code.Issue  npm -v command
 Now it should show you the same version number in the VS Terminal too!
